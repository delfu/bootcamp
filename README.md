# Welcome to the Bootcamp

This document will guide you through how to use the repository for your bootcamp experience. It will guide you through setup of your computer and how to do each workshop.

## How to use this guide

This bootcamp is designed to be assignment orientated. Each week, you'll be provided with an workshop designed to teach you different concepts. It is highly recommended to complete each week's assignment on time as future assignments might build on top of what you have achieved the previous week.

Each week will have its own folder. In the folder there will be a README.md file that provides some theory, terminologies, further readings, and assignment details.

You'll be using git and Github to send your assignment output/code/... to the instructor who will then comment and grade it. The details of how that works will be explained in Week 1

To make the class more interesting, the bootcamp is designed with an interactive story. This part of the reading is optional but recommended.

Even though the workshops are paced as "weeks", there's nothing preventing you from working through multiple weeks at once (the first time this bootcamp is run, the Weeks might actually come out one week at a time, i need to time to write them)
